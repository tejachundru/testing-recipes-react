# What is Unit Testing?

Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units or components of a software are tested in isolation from the rest of the application.

## Why do we need unit testing?

Unit testing is important because it helps us to ensure that our code is working as expected. It helps us to catch bugs early and prevent them from being released into production.

Unit testing also helps us to write more **reliable code**. By testing our code in isolation, we can ensure that it works as expected and that it doesn't have any unintended side effects.
